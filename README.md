The Neblina is a complete system-on-module solution for 9-axis motion sensing and fusion.  It can also be augmented to act as a sensor hub and support relaying information to Bluetooth Smart (Low Energy) devices.  It integrates a sophisticated battery power management and is immediately usable for new product development.  The Neblina can also be used as a standalone miniature motion recorder for experimental research, posture analysis and many other similar uses.

The ProMotion was designed to evaluate the Neblina™ core module.  Product designers who wish to get a rapid path from idea to working prototype with a path to mass production can leverage the ProMotion kit to kickstart the development process starting from a working system.

The ProMotion development kit comprises of a Neblina™ module soldered on a baseboard which includes USB connectivity for charge and firmware development, battery charging and motion data storage.  It allows the unit to record real-time motion activity for up to 5 hours even if a Bluetooth Smart device is not in the vicinity to collect the data. The development kit will let you quickly evaluate the module performance and suitability for your application and let you experiment with our patent-pending stable sensor fusion algorithms. The ProMotion allows debugging and easy firmware updates.

It comes with extensive ready-to-run demos and code samples for iOS, Android, and Desktop development (Python, JavaScript)
